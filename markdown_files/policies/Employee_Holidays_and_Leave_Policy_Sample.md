# Employee Holidays and Leave Policy Sample

At (company name), we prioritize the happiness and well-being of our employees as a fundamental factor in the growth of our conglomerate. To ensure that our staff can take time off for personal needs and recreation, we have established a comprehensive Holidays and Leave Policy.

## Understanding Leave Categories

In addition to holidays and designated days off, employees across all industries are entitled to a specific number of leaves per year. The type and quantity of leave depend on the organization, industry, and the governing regulations of the state in which the company operates. In India, we generally recognize three types of leaves: annual leave, casual leave, and medical/sick leave, all of which employees can take without loss of pay. Furthermore, we also provide maternity and paternity leave to support the well-being of our employees and their families.

## Exploring Holidays

Holidays refer to paid days off, and the Indian government announces the holiday schedule each year. These holidays are classified into three categories: gazetted, restricted, and state/union territory holidays. The number of public holidays offered by companies in India typically ranges from 10 to 14, based on industry practices, norms, and the discretion of the respective states.

## Holidays and Leave Policy

Our policy clearly outlines the recognized holidays within our company and provides relevant guidelines for holiday pay. It applies to all our employees, ensuring consistency and fairness across the organization.

## Leave Categories

**Annual Leave**

Every employee is entitled to (number of leaves) paid leaves per year. To avail annual leave, employees must provide written notification to their approving manager at least 15 days in advance. They have the flexibility to take the entire annual leave or divide it into multiple periods, with a maximum of three instances per year. Unless it conflicts with previously approved leaves, requests for annual leave cannot be refused.

Annual leave can be carried over to the following year, but no more than 12 days can be carried forward. If an employment contract expires before an employee can utilize their annual leave, compensation is provided based on the number of months and hours worked per week. Additionally, employees have the option to encash their remaining annual leave if they leave the company. Any unused annual leave beyond the entitlement is considered unpaid leave, and the corresponding day's pay is deducted from the salary.

Part-time workers and staff with irregular hours are also entitled to 14 paid holidays per year.

**Casual Leave**

Casual leave is an additional form of paid leave that employees can take without prior accrual. They may request casual leave with or without the permission of their manager. If it is not possible to inform the relevant authority before taking casual leave, employees must obtain approval within seven days after their return. Failure to do so may result in a salary deduction.

**Sick/Medical Leave**

Employees can avail themselves of sick leave when they are unwell. However, the approval of sick leave may require a medical certificate. If an employee exhausts their sick leave entitlement, they can utilize their annual leave to cover additional days off. Unused sick leave can be carried forward to the next year.

For the initial two days of sickness, employees can self-certify their absence. After two days, they will need to provide a doctor's note. If an illness occurs just before or during an employee's annual leave, they have the option to take that time as sick leave instead.

**Maternity Leave**

To be eligible for maternity benefits, a woman must have been employed by the organization for at least 80 days within the past 12 months. Payment during the maternity leave period is based on the average daily wage for the duration of absence, ensuring full paid absence from work.

Female employees are entitled to 26 weeks of maternity leave when they are pregnant. Additionally, mothers who adopt a child below the age of three months can avail themselves of a 12-week maternity leave from the date of adoption.

**Paternity Leave**

Male employees who are expecting to become fathers can take up to 15 days of leave within six months from their wife's delivery date. Once this quota is exhausted, they may choose from other paid or unpaid leave options.

**Eligibility for Leave**

Leave cannot be claimed as an absolute right. In cases where the company's exigencies necessitate it, the authority responsible for granting leave reserves the discretion to refuse or revoke leave of any type. Employees must report back to their manager under such circumstances. Failure to do so may result in disciplinary action by the organization.

## Holidays

**National Public Holidays**

The four national holidays, namely Republic Day (26th Jan), Labour Day (1st May), Independence Day (15th Aug), and Gandhi Jayanti (2nd Oct), are mandatory holidays for all employees. Additionally, the holiday calendar published at the beginning of each year specifies the other public holidays.

**Restricted Holidays**

In addition to public holidays, employees are entitled to paid days off during the festivals specific to their state of residence. These holidays, known as Restricted Holidays, allow employees to choose up to three days from the published list based on their preferences.

**Holiday Calendar**

The Holiday Calendar is published annually or at the end of the preceding year. It is also distributed via email to our employees, enabling them to plan their year accordingly.

**Compensation for Working on Public Holidays**

If an employee misses a public holiday due to a compressed workweek, they are entitled to take a compensatory day off. Employees wishing to take their substitute day must inform their manager and HR accordingly.

**Working on a Holiday**

Whenever it becomes necessary to work on holidays, we follow the following guidelines:

Non-exempt employees receive their regular hourly rate with a premium. If non-exempt employees are required to work overtime, they will be compensated with the established overtime rate.

Exempt employees receive an additional day off, to be taken within (number of months) after the holiday, as compensation for working on the holiday.
