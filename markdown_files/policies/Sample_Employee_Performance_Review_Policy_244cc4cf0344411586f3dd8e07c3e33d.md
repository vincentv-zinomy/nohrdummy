# Sample Employee Performance Review Policy

## **Encouraging Growth and Excellence**

Improving employee performance not only benefits the company but also provides opportunities for career progression. Conducting timely performance reviews allows employees to remain dedicated while enabling management to implement necessary changes, provide salary hikes, or offer training opportunities.

Additionally, a well-enforced performance review policy serves as a powerful motivational tool, inspiring employees to perform at their best potential. By outlining goal setting, employee training, rewards, and fostering communication between employees and supervisors, a performance review policy becomes a valuable HR tool for managing employee abilities, potential, and aspirations.

Our company strongly believes in bringing out the best in our employees. This not only allows us to provide optimal rewards but also offers timely training and support to build a competitive team. Our performance review policy details how and when we evaluate employee performance, emphasizing the importance of communication, learning, and development across all levels of the organization.

## **Scope of the Performance Review Policy**

This performance review policy applies to all employees unless otherwise specified. The outcomes of these reviews help us provide appropriate rewards, constructive feedback, and set encouraging goals, while also offering development opportunities to our employees.

**Defining Optimal Performance**

The company has established minimum performance requirements that every employee is expected to adhere to:

- Fulfill all job responsibilities.
- Consistently meet targets and strive to surpass previous performance levels.
- Efficiently support your team.
- Embrace new opportunities and a willingness to learn.
- Adhere to the company's code of conduct.

## **The Performance Review Process**

Employees' performances will be reviewed on a quarterly basis.

The review process includes a self-assessment by the employee and an assessment by their immediate manager/supervisor, or both.

Self-review involves evaluating one's own performance based on the resources and support provided by the company. This allows us to identify areas where additional resources can elevate performance.

Managers and supervisors will participate in a Management Review, where they will assess employee growth and performance. This review plays a vital role in determining bonuses, salary increments, and promotions.

**Training**

The performance review is crucial for determining yearly bonuses and salary increments.

Following the review, if it is identified that training in specific areas can enhance performance, employees will be provided with opportunities to improve their skills through training programs.

**Manager's Responsibilities**

If you are a manager or team leader responsible for leading and managing a team, you also have additional responsibilities to ensure optimal performance. These include:

- Setting clear and achievable objectives that motivate employees to push their limits while providing ongoing support.
- Maintaining open lines of communication and creating an environment where employees feel comfortable expressing their ideas and opinions.
- Tracking the performance and progress of specific teams and individual team members.
- Providing timely and fair constructive feedback to facilitate growth.

By implementing this performance review policy, we aim to foster a culture of excellence, continuous improvement, and professional growth within our organization.
