# Employee Code of Conduct Policy

An employee code of conduct serves as a set of principles that guide the daily actions and behaviors of individuals within an organization. It reflects the values, culture, and operations of the organization it represents, making each code of conduct unique to the specific organization.

Integrity is the cornerstone of our work. It safeguards our team, company, and clients, enhances our business performance, and sets us apart from our competitors. Our unwavering commitment to ethical practices remains our top priority. While we encourage freedom of expression and open communication, we expect all employees to adhere to our Code of Conduct.

## Purpose

Our Code of Conduct serves as the initial resource for employees seeking clarification on matters of ethical conduct. It outlines our core values, shared responsibilities, global commitments, and promises, providing general guidance on the Company's expectations. However, it is important to note that our Code cannot address every situation encountered in the workplace. Therefore, it should not replace our own sound judgment and unbiased decision-making. Each of us is responsible for our own actions, and it is essential to choose the ethical path in all circumstances.

## Scope

Our Code of Conduct applies to all employees, regardless of their employment agreement, position, or location. It also extends to third parties, such as consultants, agents, suppliers, and others acting on behalf of the Company.

## Creating a Positive Atmosphere

To promote effective work, we strive to maintain a healthy and safe environment for all. We are committed to providing a workplace free from coercion, discrimination, and harassment. Respect, inclusivity, and shared ethical values form the foundation of our core principles. Regardless of department or position, all employees must adhere to our equal opportunity policy in all aspects of work, from recruitment and performance evaluation to interpersonal relationships. Remember that any form of substance abuse, as well as the use or distribution of drugs and alcohol during working hours, is strictly prohibited.

## Compliance with Laws

We strictly comply with all applicable laws, whether they are local, national, or regional. It is the duty of every employee and those acting on our behalf to ensure the Company's adherence to legal requirements. This includes compliance with environmental regulations, safety standards, and fair business practices. Violations of the law can lead to significant harm to the Company, such as financial penalties, loss of government contracts, criminal charges, and damage to our business relationships and reputation. We expect all individuals associated with our organization to demonstrate ethical and responsible conduct when dealing with our finances, products, partnerships, and public image.

## Protection of Company Property

All employees are expected to treat the Company's property, whether tangible or intangible, with respect and care. Misuse or frivolous use of Company equipment is prohibited, and all forms of intangible property, including trademarks, copyrights, and other intellectual assets, must be respected. Employees should only use these assets for the purpose of fulfilling their job duties. Furthermore, the use of Company assets for personal gain or for any unauthorized, unlawful, or unethical purposes is strictly prohibited.

## Our Commitment to Deliverables

All employees must compete fairly and ethically for all business opportunities. Regardless of their role, employees are entrusted with serving our clients' best interests. Those involved in the sale of our products and services must ensure that all statements, communications, and representations made to clients are accurate, complete, and truthful. Similarly, employees must not make or attempt to make any unauthorized commitments on behalf of the Company or our clients. In addition, employees should not involve the Company in personal disputes with clients or others inappropriately.

## Financial Integrity and Accounting

Maintaining accurate and reliable financial and business records is of utmost importance. Employees must refrain from engaging in any actions that could convey false or inaccurate financial information to the Company or our clients. It is imperative that all submissions made on behalf of the Company or our clients are complete and accurate.

## Confidentiality of Company Information

Confidential information is a valuable asset to any organization, and it is the responsibility of every director, employee, and agent of the Company to protect it. This includes non-public information and personal information obtained during the course of business. Safeguarding confidential information and other proprietary data is essential to maintain its integrity.

## Responsible Use of Social Media

Employees are expected to comply with applicable laws and government guidelines when using social media platforms. When engaging in any form of social media, employees must adhere to this Code of Conduct. Confidential information about the Company or its employees, contractors, or third-party vendors must not be disclosed. Unless specifically instructed, employees should refrain from participating in any political or social propaganda on behalf of the Company.

## Conflict of Interest

We must actively avoid situations that present actual or potential conflicts of interest to ensure that our integrity is beyond reproach. To prevent conflicts of interest and any appearance of favoritism, employees should not directly work for, supervise, or make employment decisions about family members. Personal or romantic involvement with competitors, suppliers, or other employees of the Company may compromise an individual's ability to exercise impartial judgment on behalf of the Company, leading to conflicts of interest. Relationships between employees in a manager-employee reporting structure may pose challenges in team management and reduce morale. Such relationships must be promptly disclosed to the manager, who will take appropriate corrective action.

## Maintaining Professionalism

All employees must exhibit integrity and professionalism in the workplace, which includes the following:

**Personal Appearance:** Employees are required to adhere to our dress code and personal appearance guidelines.

**Corruption:** Accepting gifts from clients or partners is not permitted, and bribery for the benefit of any external or internal party is strictly prohibited.

**Job Duties and Authority:** Employees should fulfill their job duties with integrity and respect toward customers, stakeholders, and the community. Supervisors and managers must not abuse their authority and should delegate tasks to team members based on their capabilities and workload. Team members are expected to follow instructions from team leaders and complete their duties efficiently and within deadlines.

**Absenteeism and Tardiness:** Employees are expected to adhere to their assigned schedules. Exceptions may be made for unavoidable emergencies that prevent employees from following standard working hours or days. However, punctuality is generally expected. Any delays or absences must be promptly communicated to the employee's manager.

**Communication:** Open communication with colleagues, supervisors, and team members is encouraged for all employees.

**Benefits:** Employees should not misuse their employment benefits, including time off, insurance, facilities, subscriptions, or any other benefits provided by the Company.

**Policies:** All employees are required to familiarize themselves with and adhere to the Company's policies. If there are any questions, employees should consult their managers or the Human Resources (HR) department.

## Being a Responsible Corporate Citizen

We support and respect human rights, promote environmental responsibility, and encourage employee involvement in the communities where we operate.

## Disciplinary Actions

In cases where employees repeatedly or intentionally fail to adhere to our Code of Conduct, the Company may need to take disciplinary action. The nature of the disciplinary measures will depend on the severity of the violation and may include:

- Demotion
- Reprimand
- Suspension or termination for more serious offenses
- Reduction or loss of benefits for a specified or indefinite period

In cases involving corruption, theft, embezzlement, or other unlawful behaviors, the Company reserves the right to pursue legal action.
