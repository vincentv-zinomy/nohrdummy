At our company, we understand the importance of smooth and efficient business travel. That's why we have established an employee travel policy—a set of guidelines and rules—to ensure that official employee travel is well-managed, from start to finish. This policy serves as a helpful guide, outlining procedures for expense management, travel arrangements, authorization, and reimbursement. We want our employees to be aware of the company's guidelines regarding eligible expenses and reimbursement procedures, making business travel hassle-free for everyone.

## Purpose and Scope of the Travel Policy

**Purpose**

Our travel policy has a clear purpose: to ensure that all employees are aware of and adhere to the guidelines and rules when engaging in official travel. This policy applies to both domestic and international travel, ensuring consistency and fairness. The objectives of our travel policy are as follows:

- Clarify which travel costs will be covered by the company and which costs employees are responsible for.

Our travel policy applies to all employees authorized to travel for business purposes under our company's contract. This includes part-time and full-time employees, contractors, and paid interns. The policy covers travel arrangements for trips that are a certain distance or duration away from the office, whether they are domestic or international. We want to ensure that everyone is well-informed and supported when it comes to business travel.

## Benefits of Having a Travel Policy

Having a travel policy in place offers several benefits for both employees and the organization as a whole:

**Standardized Guidelines:** By establishing clear rules and guidelines, we ensure consistency and fairness for all employees, creating a level playing field.

**Expense Clarity:** Our travel policy provides you with clarity on eligibility criteria, expense claims, approval procedures, and our travel reimbursement policy, making it easier for you to navigate the process.

**Compliance and Control:** By adhering to our travel policy, employees help minimize the risk of unauthorized expenses, ensuring compliance with relevant laws and regulations.

**Streamlined Processes:** We have designed our travel policy to streamline the entire travel arrangement process, from booking to reimbursement. This reduces administrative burdens and increases efficiency, saving time and effort for everyone involved.

## Working with Our Company-Approved Travel Agent

To make your travel experience as smooth as possible, we have partnered with a company-approved travel agent or booking service. These agents are authorized by our company to handle travel arrangements for employees. They are here to assist you with bookings, compliance, and any necessary procedures, ensuring that your travel plans align with our travel policy.

## Travel Options: Exploring Your Choices

**Travel by Car:**

When renting a car or using a company car for business travel, you need to obtain approval from your supervisor. Simply submit a travel request form and document all expenses incurred during the trip for reimbursement. We will review the form and reimburse expenses according to our travel policy, making sure you're supported every step of the way.

**Travel by Bus:**

If you choose to travel by bus, we encourage you to book the most economical seats. There may be additional restrictions on luggage, travel time, and the number of employees traveling together. Make your bookings through our designated travel coordinator, following specific guidelines for cancellation. And remember, travel expense forms are required for reimbursement, so keep those receipts handy.

**Travel by Flight:**

For air travel, we recommend booking through our company-approved agency or online platform to secure the best available fare. Depending on the nature of your business trip, you may be required to book the lowest-cost airfare or have flexibility for luxury seats with appropriate approvals. However, please avoid making last-minute changes to flights unless approved by your manager. As always, travel expense forms are typically necessary for reimbursement, so keep track of your receipts.

## Lodging: Finding the Right Accommodation

When it comes to lodging, we have pre-approved options that align with our travel policy. We encourage you to book reasonably priced hotels, unless circumstances require otherwise. Standard rooms are preferred, and we recommend choosing accommodations located near your business or event venue. If you incur additional lodging expenses, make sure to obtain approval from your supervisor. Additionally, please adhere to hotel policies and procedures during your stay.

## Meal Expenses: Nourishing Your Business Travel

We understand that meal expenses are an integral part of business travel. Therefore, we reimburse employees for reasonable meal expenses incurred during their trips. Make sure to collect receipts for all your meal expenses. However, please note that alcohol expenses and expenses for companions may require pre-approval or may not be reimbursed. Our reimbursement is based on the distance traveled or the duration of the trip and follows our company's allowable amount per day.

## Business Expenses: Supporting Your Business Needs

Certain business-related expenses that are necessary but not covered under our travel policy, such as seminar fees, conference expenses, or vehicle rentals, require approval from your supervisor. Please make sure to document these expenses and submit a travel expense form if required. We want to ensure that you have the support you need to carry out your business responsibilities effectively.

## Phone Calls: Staying Connected

We understand that staying connected is essential during business travel. Therefore, business-related phone calls are reimbursed by the company. Remember to retain receipts for all your phone call expenses. However, personal phone calls and internet usage are generally not reimbursed, and employees are expected to use their own cell phones for personal use.

## Visa and Passport Fees: Enabling International Travel

If you require a visa or passport for business travel purposes, we will reimburse you for the fees incurred. Keep your receipts for these expenses. However, please be aware that we may have restrictions on additional costs, expecting employees to incur reasonable expenses. Any additional costs may require approval for reimbursement, so make sure to consult with your supervisor if necessary.

## Authorization and Responsibility: Your Role in the Process

Authorization is an important part of the travel process. As an employee, you are responsible for obtaining the necessary approvals, ensuring that your travel arrangements align with our travel policy. Certain expenses, such as business class airfare, luxury accommodations, and international travel expenses, require pre-approval. We count on you to provide accurate documentation and submit your travel expense reports in a timely manner, enabling a smooth reimbursement process.

## Non-Reimbursable Travel Expenses: What's Not Covered

While our travel policy is designed to support you during your business travel, there are certain expenses that are not reimbursable. These include personal entertainment expenses, traffic or parking violations, non-adherence to laws and regulations, unapproved travel companions, lost or stolen personal/work items, travel insurance costs, expenses due to personal choices, and any expenses not approved by the company. We appreciate your understanding and cooperation in adhering to these guidelines.
