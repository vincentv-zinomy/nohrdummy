# Sample Exit Policy

## Introduction to the Exit Policy

An exit policy outlines the procedures and guidelines that govern the separation of an employee from the company, whether through voluntary resignation or termination. This policy is designed to ensure a smooth and transparent transition during the separation process, minimizing any potential conflicts or misunderstandings between the parties involved.

## Scope of the Policy

This policy provides a comprehensive overview of the termination and separation process implemented by the company. It covers various aspects, including release formalities, notice periods, treatment of benefits, and exit interview procedures. The policy is applicable to all employees throughout the organization, unless otherwise specified.

## Termination Conditions

An employee will be considered terminated from the company if any of the following conditions are met:

**Voluntary Resignation:**

When an employee chooses to resign voluntarily, they must submit a resignation letter to their immediate supervisor, copying the Human Resources Team. The employee is required to serve a notice period of XX days (unless stated otherwise in their employment agreement) from the date of providing written notice.

During this notice period, the employee is expected to fulfill their professional obligations as usual. Any violation of this requirement may result in an extension of the notice period, as determined by the management. Failure to comply with the notice period may result in a penalty ranging from XX to an amount not exceeding the employee's last drawn salary.

**Dismissal:**

The company may terminate an employee's services for reasons such as inadequate skills or work performance, improper behavior or attitude, lack of integrity, material discrepancies in provided information during the hiring process, or any other factor that hinders the company's objectives. In cases of dismissal, the company reserves the right to enforce immediate separation without prior notice.

## Exit Formalities

Upon separation, certain formalities and procedures need to be followed:

**Benefits and Compensation:**

All benefits, including insurance coverage, cease to exist from the date of resignation or the last day of employment. Compensatory leaves, if applicable, will not be reimbursed in monetary form. If the employee has a Provident Fund (PF) account with the company, it will be settled accordingly. Third-party PF arrangements will remain unaffected unless the employee decides otherwise, in which case any transactions will be solely between the employee and the third party.

**Reimbursements:**

Any pending reimbursements should be submitted before the completion of the notice period.

**Return of Company Assets:**

The employee is required to return all company assets, including but not limited to technological devices, company credit cards, vehicles, and identity cards, on or before the last day of the notice period. Failure to adhere to this requirement may delay or disrupt the termination process.

**Relieving Letter:**

Upon completion of the termination process, the company will issue a relieving letter to the employee.

## Exit Interview

To improve employee satisfaction and gather feedback, the Human Resources Team may conduct an exit interview. We kindly request your cooperation and honesty during this process to help us gain valuable insights.

## Conclusion

This exit policy serves as a guideline for the separation process, ensuring a clear understanding of the procedures and expectations involved. The company aims to facilitate a respectful and smooth transition for both the departing employee and the organization.
